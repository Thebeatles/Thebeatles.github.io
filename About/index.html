        About The Beatles
    </div>


    <div class="main">
        <p>"No band has influenced pop culture the way the Beatles have. They
        were one of the best things to happen in the twentieth century, let
        alone the Sixties. They were youth personified. They were unmatched
        innovators who were bigger than both Jesus and rock & roll itself:
        During the week of April 4, 1964, the Beatles held the first five slots
        on the Billboard Singles chart; they went on to sell more than a
        billion records; and 2000's 1, a compilation of the Beatles Number One
        hits, hit Number One in 35 countries and went on to become the
        best-selling album of the 2000s."</p>
