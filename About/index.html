    <p>"No band has influenced pop culture the way the Beatles have. They were one of the
      best things to happen in the twentieth century, let alone the Sixties. They were youth
      personified. They were unmatched innovators who were bigger than both Jesus and rock &
      roll itself: During the week of April 4, 1964, the Beatles held the first five slots on
      the Billboard Singles chart; they went on to sell more than a billion records; and
      2000's 1, a compilation of the Beatles Number One hits, hit Number One in 35 countries
      and went on to become the best-selling album of the 2000s."</p>
