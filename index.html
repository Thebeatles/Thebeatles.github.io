                Music has a very big effect on modern American society, especially with teenagers
                and young adults. The Beatles were one of the most influential artists of their
                time not only because of their impact on the music industry, but hair styles,
                clothing and morality. Groupies from their followings contributed to the beginning
                of the hippie revolution. Their free spirited nature was unique and new to its era
                and a diversity from the Elvis rock music that had just started changing the music
                culture. The Beatles music was quickly accepted into society although it was
                rebellious for its time, and introduced a new type of music into modern day life.
                We chose The Beatles Influence on American Society as our National History Day
                project because they were a milestone for change within the music community that
                contributed to an overall cultural change in our society.
